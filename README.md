# 755final - Product Placement on Sales Volume for In-Store Shopping



## Introduction & Goals of this Project

This study examines the effect of product placement within stores on sales volume, focusing on various item types such as clothing, electronics, and food. It explores whether the location of products—aisle, end-cap, or front of store—affects their sales performance. The analysis also incorporates seasonal factors, ongoing promotions, and demographic information. Using a dataset obtained from Kaggle with ten variables and 1,000 observations, the study employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), logistic regressions, random forests, and ANOVA tests. The results indicate limited predictive power of product placement on sales volume. This study found no significant predictors of sales with the given variables. 

To complete this task, I sought to incorporate these four techniques/tools we learned about over the course of the semester. 

1. Sourcing data from external repositories 
2. GitHub
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Overleaf (LaTeX)


## Key files 

- [Notebook File - final731.ipynb](/code/final731.ipynb)

This is the notebook file with the code relevant to my project. 

- [Source CSV ](/data/product_positioning_raw.csv)

I sourced this data from Kaggle. I searched for datasets related to consumer habits in an attempt to play with data related to in store shopping trends.

- [Compiled Report - LaTeX](/code/Overleaf/Overleaf%20-%20Product%20Placement.pdf)
- [Raw LaTeX file](code/Overleaf/Overleaf%20(raw)%20-%20Product%20Placement.tex)

Above are (1) my compiled report detailing the statistical analysis I performed and (2) the raw LaTeX file drafted in Overleaf which compiles into the version above it. 


## Project Packages

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Numpy 
- Seaborn
- sklearn
- SciPy
- MatPlotLib

## Technical Difficulties 

I discovered issues running certain functions from key packages in my base python installation.  I creted a virtual environment exclusively for this project and installed the requisite packages within. Additionally, I had to install and set up a jupyter kernel in the virtual environment using ipykernel.
